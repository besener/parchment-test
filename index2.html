    <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
    <p>This course explores the medieval Mediterranean world&rsquo;s art, architecture, archaeology, and material culture from late antiquity to the early modern period, or between the late 4th and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. While the Renaissance blossomed in Italy in the 1400s, in the course, we will investigate the medieval art, architectural elements, and art forms that circulated among Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities around the Mediterranean until the 16<sup>th</sup> century. We will study the geographies of the Mediterranean Sea&mdash;including Italy, Spain, Egypt, North Africa, the Balkans, Anatolia, the Holy Land, and the Middle East&mdash;focusing on their rulers, kingdoms, merchants, craftsmen, pilgrims, and travelers. These figures will guide our investigation into the movement, migration, exchange, and patronage across the region while exploring the role of art and architecture in the sacred and secular lives of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities. Through our study of monuments (including architecture, mosaics, and wall paintings), objects (such as ceramics, metalwork, coins, ivory, and textiles), and historical texts, we will examine the cultural and political dynamics that defined the medieval Mediterranean world. We will also engage with spatial thinking and digital tools through ArcGIS StoryMaps as part of the <em>Digital Mediterranean</em> project, gaining skills in mapping artistic exchange. A visit to the library&rsquo;s Map Room will offer hands-on experience with medieval and early modern maps to explore how the Mediterranean was represented and navigated, while a Block Museum study session focused on <em>Shahnameh</em> folios will provide a close analysis of artistic techniques in Persian illustrated manuscripts.</p>
